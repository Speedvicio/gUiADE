A Crappy Frontend for <a href="http://zakalwe.fi/uade/">UADE - Unix Amiga Delitracker Emulator.</a>

This is my second attemp (the first was AmicoX on linux) to make a crappy frontend for UADE.

Attached there is the UADE help command line manual (UADE readme.txt) , you can input others parameters on "custom parameters" text.

- Has support for most common archive compressed file by 7z and sevenzipsharp.

- Can export wav file in Quad mode  (4 channels mode) thx to <a href="https://blog.airmann.de/uade-multichannel-audio-support/">UADE 4IRMANN fork.</a>

- Can play Pretracker format thx to <a href="https://github.com/arnaud-neny/rePlayer/commit/6f410a75f42204c12b073b592313190fa337a212">UADE arnaud-neny fork.</a>

- Can play common Mp3 and Wav file.

- Can create custom playlist for your favourite music.

gUiADE use Topaz_a500_v1.0.ttf that should be load at startup, if you see the wrong visualized font, you can try to install it onto your os.

From release 6°,  gUiADE run only on win Vista and upper the last release compatible on Win XP is <a href="https://github.com/Speedvicio/gUiADE/releases/tag/0.5.">gUiADE 5°</a>.
