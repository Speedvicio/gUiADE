# gUiADE
A Crappy Frontend for <a href="http://zakalwe.fi/uade/">UADE - Unix Amiga Delitracker Emulator.</a>

This is my second attemp (the first was AmicoX on linux) to make a crappy frontend for UADE.

Attached there is the UADE help command line manual (UADE readme.txt) , you can input others parameters on "custom parameters" text.

gUiADE also has support for most common archive compressed file by 7z and sevenzipsharp.

gUiADE can export wav file in Quad mode  (4 channels mode) thx to <a href="https://blog.airmann.de/uade-multichannel-audio-support/">UADE 4IRMANN fork.</a>

gUiADE use Topaz_a500_v1.0.ttf that should be load at startup, if you see the wrong visualized font, you can try to install it onto your os.

gUiADE run on Win XP and above.
